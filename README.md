Truffle Pet Shop Tutorial - my first dApp
This repository contains code for a simple digital pet shop created using Truffle, a tool for building decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain.

Steps
Setup: Initialize the project with Truffle.
Smart Contracts: Define rules for the pet shop using Solidity.
Compile and Deploy: Compile the contracts and deploy them to a local blockchain.
Front-End: Build a basic front-end to interact with the pet shop contracts.
Testing: Test the functionality of the pet shop to ensure everything works as expected.
Deployment: Deploy the pet shop to a public Ethereum network for real-world use.
